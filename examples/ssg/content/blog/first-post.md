## Why I Love Crystal

Crystal is awesome because:

1. **Ruby-like syntax** - Beautiful and readable
2. **Compiled** - Fast performance
3. **Type-safe** - Catches errors at compile time

### Code Example

```crystal
def greet(name : String) : String
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

puts greet("World")  # => "Hello, World!"
```
