# Croupier

Croupier is a smart task definition and execution library.

## What does that mean?

You use Croupier to define tasks. Tasks have:

* A name
* Zero or more input files
* One output file
* A `Proc` that consumes the inputs and produces the output

And here is the fun part:

Croupier will examine the inputs and outputs for your tasks and
use them to build a dependency graph. This expresses the connections
between your tasks and the files on disk, and between tasks, and **will 
use that information to decide what to run**.

So, suppose you have `task1` consuming `input.txt` producing `fileA` and `task2` that has `fileA` as input and outputs `fileB`

Croupier guarantees the following:

* If `task1` has not run before, it *will run*
* If `task1` has run before and `input.txt` has not changed, it *will not run*.
* If `task1` has run before and Ã¬nput.txt` has changed, it *will run*
* If `task1` runs, `task2` *will run*
* `task1` will run *earlier* than `task2`

That's a very long way to say: Croupier will run whatever needs running, based on the content of the dependency files and the dependencies between tasks.

The state between runs is kept in `.croupier` so if you delete that file
all tasks will run.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     croupier:
       github: your-github-user/croupier
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

This is the example described above, in actual code:

```crystal
require "croupier"

b1 = ->{
  File.open("fileA", "w") do |io|
    puts "task1 running"
    io.puts File.read("input.txt").downcase
  end
}

Croupier::Task.new(
  name: "task1",
  output: "fileA",
  inputs: ["input.txt"],
  block: b1
)

b2 = ->{
  File.open("fileB", "w") do |io|
    puts "task2 running"
    io.puts File.read("fileA").upcase
  end
}
Croupier::Task.new(
  name: "task2",
  output: "fileB",
  inputs: ["fileA"],
  block: b2 
)

Croupier::Task.run_tasks
```

If we create a `index.txt` file with some text in it and run this program, it will print it's running `task1` and `task2` and produce `fileA` with that same text in upper case, and `fileB` with the text in lowercase.

The second time we run it, it will *only* run `task2`, because `fileA` now contains different text compared to the 1st time (when it didn't exist)

The third time we run it, it will *do nothing* because all tasks dependencies are unchanged.

If we modify `index.txt` or `fileA` then one or both will tasks will run, as needed.
