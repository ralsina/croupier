Thinks it may make sense to add:

* Tasks without file output
* Tasks with more than one output
* ~~Run only tasks needed to produce specific outputs~~
* Instrument the concurrent runner using https://github.com/didactic-drunk/fiber_metrics.cr
* Maybe migrate to crotest or microtest (Nicer)
* Automate running crytic every now and then
