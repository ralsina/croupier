Thinks it may make sense to add:

* Tasks without file output
* Tasks with more than one output
* Tasks that operate in-place (output is also input)
* ~~Run only tasks needed to produce specific outputs~~
* Instrument the concurrent runner using https://github.com/didactic-drunk/fiber_metrics.cr
* Maybe migrate to crotest or microtest (Nicer)
* ~~Automate running crytic every now and then~~
* Once it works fine with files, generalize to a k/v store using [kiwi](ihttps://github.com/crystal-community/kiwi)
